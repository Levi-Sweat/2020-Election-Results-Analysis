        "Initially, I was planning to compare the 2020 and 2024 presidential election results county by county, and specifically analyze how the Covid-19 Pandemic affected voting in different counties based on their demographic information. Unfortunately, the author of the dataset said they would update to contain the 2024 election results has yet to be updated, so I've decided to pivot the target goals of my project. I will now analyze and predict the share of Republican/Democratic voters in the 2020 presidential election county-by-county. I will also analyze if the covid-19 pandemic played a major role in how people voted, as the pandemic was increasingly affecting people's day-to-day life around the time of the 2020 election.\n",

        "Now we can combine the dataframes. Notice that the covid df contains 3110 observations and the election df 3143 observations. This is likely due to how the census data is being reported and which counties answer which census information, which might be different for the covid dataset. A quick google reveals there are a total of 3,144 counties (or county equivalents) in the US, so I'm comfortable dropping off the counties that are in the election data so that the resulting dataframe only contains counties that are in both Dataframes."

This resuled in a MSE of 55 and a MAE of 5.8. Considering how poorly correlated the variables were, this is pretty solid. Note that the accuracy for many of the models above is 0 because only one target is being predicted for those models, so accuracy cannot be calculated.\n",
